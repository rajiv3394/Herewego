Below are my observations on data : (population size : 100)

1. Correlation found to be 0.76 between variables Price and Area. Seems like there is a strong connection between them (i.e) in positive way.

2. However if you see the line plot (uploaded by name : House_price_vs_Area.png) closely , you can observe a slight fluctuation in line. Assuming there are anomalies ( could be due to listing price higher or lower than the market value for particular built area) in data. 

3. Anomalies might even lead to selling house for price lesser than usual which can be advantage to person who is interested in. However i need to study more about these anomalies in detail and come up with interesting things.

4. Correlation found to be 0.43 between variables "Price" and "Bedrooms". "Bedrooms" variable has neither strong nor weak impact on Price. More details need to be analyzed and hence couldnt say anything for now.  

# Will update more soon. Stay tuned!
